# AQI_ML
## Air Quality Index (AQI) Predictor using Machine Learning
# Overview
The Air Quality Index (AQI) Predictor is a machine learning project that aims to forecast the air quality index based on historical and real-time environmental data. The model can be used to help governments, organizations, and individuals take timely action to minimize health risks due to air pollution.

# Features
Predicts AQI levels based on input features such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, temperature, and humidity.

Supports both regression (numerical AQI prediction) and classification (AQI category prediction).

Can be trained on publicly available datasets such as those from the U.S. EPA or India CPCB.

Easily deployable as a web application using Flask or Streamlit.
